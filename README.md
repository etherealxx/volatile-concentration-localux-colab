# Project VCL-Colab
Another camenduru colab ~~clone~~ alternative.üòã
May only works for Colab Pro user.

Features:
- All camenduru colab flavor in one single colab
- Option to choose model from a Gradio UI directly on Colab cell output
- Automatic update, synced in real time with Camenduru's repo
- ~~Bypass the damned google colab warning (when it detects `stable-diffusion-webui` and `sd-webui` string)~~ MAY NOT WORK ANYMORE.

The automatic update works by basically scraping from camenduru's repo, so it will automatically update the model list everytime camenduru's repo got new models.<br/>
As long as he doesn't change much on the repo code, this colab will always works without the need to maintain it.

Basically proof-of-concept. Would like to hear feedbacks and suggestion on the issues page.

Huge thanks to [camenduru](https://github.com/camenduru), without him this colab wouldn't be possible. Check out his [original repo](https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Note!
- The usual `/content/stable-diffusion-webui` is renamed to `/content/volatile-concentration-localux`, just keep in mind. Every file and folder inside is normal. (Pretty obvious though)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Got an Error 403?
Read [here](https://github.com/etherealxx/volatile-concentration-localux-colab/blob/main/error403guide.md) for guide to fix it.

### üÜô Latest Update:
- 10/01/2024 (February): Gradio version bump to v3.41.2. Updated `choosemodel4.py` to exclude camenduru's 'run' colab. Added `httpx` pip install. Merging the September branch (lol i forgot)
- 10/09/2023 (September): Added `sd-webui-reactor` (roop alternative) as optional choosable extension. `additionalextensions.txt` now support running bash code if an extension is selected (mostly for dependencies).

  <summary>Older Updates</summary>

    - 12/08/2023 (August): Gradio version bump to v3.37.0 (fixing the bug where extension selection doesn't appear and when orange button is pressed, error JSON input will shows up). ~~gradio_client version bump to v0.2.10 to matches the Gradio version.~~
    - 27/07/2023 (July): Memory fix. The sed lines are now synced with camenduru's repo.
    - 22/07/2023 (July): Added a little bit of documentation on the colab notebook. Removed unused old scripts. Fixed bug where unticking `choose_model` while at the same time ticking `controlnet_models` on the notebook makes SD fails to launch. Now changing branch after running the main cell atleast once will preserve the previously downloaded models and generated outputs.
    - 20/07/2023 (July): Added functionality for the extension installer where extension's branch and commits are choosable in `additionalextensions.txt`. Removed the whole `libtcmalloc` lines. Adjusted the way this colab gather the code with the recent changes.
    - 10/07/2023 (July): Added `sd-webui-cutoff`, `sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing`, `ultimate-upscale-for-automatic1111`, and `adetailer` as optional choosable extension. Now optional extensions are stored on `additionalextensions.txt`. Now optional extensions are listed at the bottom of the extension checkboxes on the gradio UI.
    - 07/07/2023 (July): Fixed some typo in the repo extract code (fixed lite branch). Added `torchmetrics==0.11.4` as an additional dependency for lite branch.
    - 02/07/2023 (July): Bypass the new colab warning that detects `sd-webui` string.
    - 16/06/2023 (June): Added `a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete` and `composable-lora extension` as optional choosable extension. Fixed 'all extension is missing' bug.
